## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

  I tend to wait too long to ask questions. Not because of hesitation or feeling of looking stupid, I do that anyway, but because it is a point of pride and satisfaction to figure it out on my own. I view asking for help as an admission that I was unable to figure it out on my own with a negative connotation and I am actively trying to change that mindset.  

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

So far I am not quite outside of my comfort zone in terms of experience to programming (thank you codecademy). However, I did have to research how to capitalize the first letter of a string within a function parameter and Stack overflow was able to help me out.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

Giving specific instructions to the program of what to do in a circumstance of true/false.
I give conditional statements to my 2 year old all day. Are you hungry? If so, then lets eat. Are you tired? Should we go sleep? etc.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

You add as many else if statements as you need. The code continues through the blocks until it hits a true, executes the block, then exits the loop.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

the && and || in an if statement

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
