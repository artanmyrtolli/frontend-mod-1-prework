1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

 None, really.
1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

All of them.
1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

storing past passwords to make sure new password doesnt match it

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

for each value in this list, do this

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

to harness the power of processors instead of completing out mundane/complicated tasks by hand.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

Suppose you have a box with 10 toys in it, and you want to take all of them out of the box.
One way to specify that is to say, "while the box has toys in it, remove a toy from the box". Once the box has no toys, the loop is done.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
