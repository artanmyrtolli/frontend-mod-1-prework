## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

  - Teaching others is my favorite on this list and something I try to do every chance I get. In addition to retaining the information better, I enjoy the satisfaction of enabling others.
  - I'm a big believer in short breaks often. Stimulating blood flow in the body enables better learning.
  - I'm a vegetarian so by default I eat a lot of vegetables and blueberries are one of my favorite foods, ever since I heard a few years they got classified as a `superfood`


2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

  - Numbers. In decimals, negative, or whole Numbers
  - String. Basically any phrase, can even be numbers or emojis, as long as its wrapped in " or ' , it will take the phrase exactly.
  - Boolean. True or false or any equation/function that returns true or false.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

  console.log('"Hello World"');

  //would not normally use double quotations, but to print specifically "Hello World" you would need them.

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

    A description of a value you will need to remember.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

userName; username; userEmail;

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

adding different data types / variables
 together to print cohesive statements.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
